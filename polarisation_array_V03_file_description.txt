The file "polarisation_array_V03.mat" contains the variable "polarr" which is a double array of size [n,16].
"n" is the number of Langmuir waves caused by an in situ type III. event for which we were able to determine their polarisation.

The columns of the array are described below

col  n: (variable name)	description		[units]
col  1: (f)			polarisation factor	- F=E^2_{\perp}/(E^2_{||} + E^2_{\perp}); F=1 => transverse, F=0 => linear	[dimensionless]
col  2: (erms)		energy rms 	- Total wave energy. 												[not sure, calculated with std (ask JS)]
col  3: (beamenerg)	beam energy	- Beam speed in energy units.											[eV]
col  4: (rtt)		radio time	- Time of the in situ event marking the appearance of radio signal in TDS RSWF data.	[epoch]
col  5: (langtt)		langmuir wave time	- First appearance of langmuir wave after rtt in RSWF.				[epoch]
col  6: (epdtt)		epd time	- Marks an increase of particle flux or the beginning of particle beam in EPD STEP data.	[epoch]
col  7: (r)			distance from the Sun	- Distance from the Sun										[AU]
col  8: (sw_vel)		solar wind velocity														[km/s]
col  9: (clockang)	magnetic field clock angle													[deg]
col 10: (coneang)		magnetic field cone angle													[deg]
col 11: (magfstrength)	magnetic field strength														[nT]
col 12: (den_tnr)		plasma density from TNR														[particles/cm^3]
col 13: (den_pas)		plasma density from PAS														[particles/cm^3]
col 14: (den_bias)	plasma density from BIAS													[particles/cm^3]
col 15: (den)		custom product with priorities: 1. TNR, 2. PAS (+4%), 3. BIAS (probably useless)				[particles/cm^3]
col 16: (tt)		timetag for cross-checking													[epoch]
